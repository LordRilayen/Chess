2) Design
    The Game Board
    - The game board is contained in an actor called BP_GameBoard 
    - BP_GameBoard is not rendered, but instead serves as a collection of BP_GridLocations which represents the board as a whole

    Squares on the Board
    - Each square is a BP_GridLocation
    - Each square knows whether it is black or white, and has a DefaultMaterial storing the appropriate material. The active material on the Surface component 
        is determined by the material in this variable, and whether or not the square IsSelected
        - IsSelected is equal to True, then set Surface material to M_Selection_Glow
        - IsSelected is equal to False, then set Surface material to DefaultMaterial
